# Network_Based_Data_Analysis_project

This repository contains the data and analysis I conducted for the "Network Based Data Analysis" course, taught by Professor Mario Lauria, as part of the QCB study path at the University of Trento (academic year 2022/2023).

In the file NDBA_project.Rmd, you will find all the analyses performed on the dataset directly available from the GEOquery library with ID = GSE166502. The file [NBDA_report](.NBDA_report.txt) summarizes all my efforts in a report required for course evaluation, while [NDBA_presentation.pdf](.NDBA_presentation.pdf) includes the PowerPoint presentation used for my oral examination.
